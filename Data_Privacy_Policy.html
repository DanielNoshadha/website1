			You may ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by managing your subscriptions, by checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by <a href="Contacts.html">contacting us</a> at any time.
			<br><strong>COOKIES</strong></br>
			You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see our <a href="Cookie_Policy.html">Cookie Policy</a>.
			<br><strong>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</strong></br>
			We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to obtain an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please <a href="Contacts.html">contact us</a>.
			<br>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</br>
	</li></P>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
			We share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
			<br><strong>INTERNAL THIRD PARTIES</strong></br>
			Other entities in the Noshadha Law Firm acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the Ukraine and provide IT and system administration services and internal reporting with respect to website use.
			<br><strong>EXTERNAL THIRD PARTIES</strong></br>
			Service providers acting as processors based in the US and countries within the European Economic Area (EEA) and EU who provide IT security and system administration services.
			<Br>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers, including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the US and countries within the EEA and EU who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</br>
			<br>Noshadha Law Firm and regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based in the Ukraine who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.<br>
			<br>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</br>
	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong>
	For those based in the EU or EEA: We share your personal data within the Noshadha Law Firm. This will involve transferring your data outside the EEA to other offices within the Noshadha Law Firm.
	<br>Many of our external third parties are based outside the EEA, so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA to the US.</br>
	<br>Whenever we transfer your personal data outside the EEA to the countries identified above, and specifically to the US, we ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to such data by using standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission (as permitted under Article 46(2)(c)) that are designed to help safeguard your privacy rights. For further details, see European Commission: Model Contracts for the Transfer of Personal Data to Third Countries.</br>
	<br>Please <a href="Contacts.html">contact us</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</br>
	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong>
	We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
	<br>We have established procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</br>
	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>DATA RETENTION</strong>
	<strong>FOR HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA?</strong>
	We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
	<br>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements.</br>
	<br><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS </strong></br>
	<strong>Subject to certain limitations, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These rights include the rights to:</strong>
	<ul class="ul">
		<li><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong>(commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Note that we may refuse to comply with a request for access if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive in nature.</li>
		<li><strong>Request correction of your personal data.</strong>This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Note that we may refuse to comply with a request for correction if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive in nature.</li>
		<li><strong>Request erasure of your personal data.</strong>This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note that we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
		<li><strong>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</strong>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data, even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Note that we may refuse to comply with a request for restriction if the request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive in nature.</li>
		<li><strong>Request transfer of your personal data.</strong>We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies where your personal data is processed by us with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and when processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
		<li><strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong>You can withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</li>
	</ul>
	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>YOUR RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>
	<br><strong>DIRECT MARKETING</strong></br>
	<Br>You have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.</br>
	<br><strong>PROCESSING OF YOUR INFORMATION BASED ON OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</strong></br>
	<br>You also have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal information which is based on our legitimate interests. Where you object on this ground, we shall no longer process your personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</br>

	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS</strong>
	<br>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, including withdrawing consent, please <a href="Contacts..html">contact us</a> and give us specific details regarding which right you choose to exercise.</br>
	<br><strong>NO FEE REQUIRED </strong></br>
	<br>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights mentioned above); however, in circumstances where access requests are clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may refuse to comply.</br>
	<br><strong>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU </strong></br>
	<br>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request in order to speed up our response.</br>
	<br><strong>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</strong></br>
	<br>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</br>
	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>COMPLAINTS</strong>
	<br>If you have concerns relating to your data privacy or the processing of your personal data, please <a href="Contacts.html">contact us</a> in the first instance in order that we may assist you in allaying any such concerns. In certain circumstances in any EU member state, you may have recourse to the local data protection authority in the jurisdiction of the office in which services are being provided. We will cooperate fully with any such authority.</br>

	</li></p>
	<p><li type="1"><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
	<br>Noshadha Law Firm reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</br></li></P>
